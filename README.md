# RepData_PeerAssessment2
Reproducible Research Project 2
DATA:  The original data from National Weather Service is in this file repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2.

I created 3 subsets of this data (prop.csv, crop.csv, storm.csv) so I could work with ggplot without rereading the original dataset,
which was time consuming on my computer.  

The PA2_template_bkup.Rmd is a backup of the solution prior to PA2_template.Rmd.  
PA2_template.Rmd contains the final solution.
