# RepData_PeerAssessment2
Reproducible Research Project 2
DATA:  The original data from National Weather Service is in this file repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2.

I created 3 subsets of this data (prop.csv, crop.csv, storm.csv) so I could work with ggplot without rereading the original dataset,
which was time consuming on my computer.  I used the Peer2a.R file to play with ggplot2.   

The PA2_template_bkup.Rmd is a backup of the solution prior to PA2_template.Rmd.  
PA2_teplate.md and PA2_template.Rmd contain the final solutions.

The plot output can be seen in the Figures directory.
